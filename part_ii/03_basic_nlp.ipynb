    "\n",
    "> Security precautions were being taken around the `HIDDEN` as the deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait neared.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can probably make informed guesses on the `HIDDEN` words based on your knowledge of the English language and the world in general.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, creating a statistical language model involves observing the occurrence of words in large corpora and calculating their probabilities of occurrence in a given context. The language model can then be trained by making predictions and adjusting the model based on the errors made during prediction."
