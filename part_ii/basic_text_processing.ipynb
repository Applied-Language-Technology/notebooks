    "## Computers and text\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers can store and represent text in different formats. Knowing the distinction between different types of text is crucial for processing them programmatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is rich text?\n",
    "\n",
    "Word processors, such as Microsoft Word, produce [rich text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formatted_text), that is, text whose appearance has been formatted or styled in a specific way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich text allows defining specific visual styles for document elements. Headers, for example, may use a different font than the body text, which may in turn feature *italic* or **bold** fonts for emphasis. Rich text can also include various types of images, tables and other document elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rich text is the default format for modern what-you-see-is-what-you-get word processors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is plain text?\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike rich text, [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text) does not contain any information about the visual appearance of text, but consists of *characters* only.\n",
    "\n",
    "Characters, in this context, refers to letters, numbers, punctuation marks, spaces and line breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The definition of plain text is fairly loose, but generally the term refers to text which lacks any formatting or style information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is structured text?\n",
    "\n",
    "Structured text may be thought of as a special case of plain text, which includes character sequences that are used to format the text for display.\n",
    "\n",
    "Forms of structured text include text described using mark-up languages such as XML, Markdown or HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below shows a plain text sentence wrapped into HTML tags for paragraphs `<p>`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The opening tag `<p>` and the closing tag `</p>` instruct the computer that any content placed between these tags form a paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "``` \n",
    "<p>This is an example sentence.</p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This information is used for structuring plain text when *rendering* text for display, typically by styling its appearance."

    "### Why does this matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you collect a bunch of texts for a corpus, chances are that some originated in rich or structured format, depending on the medium these texts came from.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you collect printed documents that have been digitized using a technique such as [optical character recognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) (OCR) and subsequently converted from rich into plain text, the removal of formatting information is likely to introduce errors into the resulting plain text. Working with this kind of \"dirty\" OCR can have an impact on the results of text analysis (Hill & Hengchen [2019](https://doi.org/10.1093/llc/fqz024)).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you collect digital documents by scraping discussion forums or websites, you are likely to encounter traces of structured text in the form of markup tags, which may be carried over to plain text during conversion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plain text is by far the most interchangeable format for text, as it is easy to read for computers. This is why programming languages work with plain text, and if you plan to use programming languages to manipulate text, you need to know what plain text is. \n",
    "\n",
    "To summarise, when working with plain text, you may need to deal with traces left by conversion from rich or structured text."

    "## Text encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "To be read by computers, plain text needs to be *encoded*. This is achieved using *character encoding*, which maps characters (letters, numbers, punctuation, whitespace ...) to a numerical representation understood by the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we should not have to deal with low-level operations such as character encoding, but practically we do, because there are multiple systems for encoding characters, and these codings are not compatible with each other. This is the source of endless misery and headache when working with plain text.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two character encoding systems that you are likely to encounter: ASCII and Unicode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASCII\n",
    "\n",
    "[ASCII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII), which stands for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, is a pioneering character encoding system that has provided a foundation for many modern character encoding systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "ASCII is still widely used, but is very limited in terms of its character range. If your language happens to include characters such as ä or ö, you are out of luck with ASCII.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unicode\n",
    "\n",
    "[Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) is a standard for encoding text in most writing systems used across the world, covering nearly 140 000 characters in modern and historic scripts, symbols and emoji.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the pizza slice emoji 🍕 has the Unicode \"code\" `U+1F355`, whereas the corresponding code for a whitespace is `U+0020`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unicode can be implemented by different character encodings, such as [UTF-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8), which is defined by the Unicode standard.\n",
    "\n",
    "UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII. In other words, the ASCII character encodings form a subset of UTF-8, which makes our life much easier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Even if a plain text file has been *encoded* in ASCII, we can *decode* it using UTF-8, but **not vice versa**."
