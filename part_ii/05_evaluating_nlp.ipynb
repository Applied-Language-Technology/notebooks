    "\n",
    "Precision is the *proportion of correct predictions per class*. In plain words, precision tells you how many predictions were correct for each class, or part-of-speech tag.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the sum for column VERB is $2$, of which $1$ prediction is correct (that which is located in the row VERB).\n",

    "Hence precision for VERB is $1 / 2 = 0.5$ ‚Äì half of the tokens predicted to be verbs were classified correctly. The same holds true for NOUN, as the column sums up two $2$, but only $1$ prediction is in the correct row.\n",

    "Recall, in turn, gives the proportion of correct predictions for all examples of that class. \n",
    "\n",
    "Put differently, recall tells you *how many actual instances of a given class the model was able to \"find\"*.\n",
