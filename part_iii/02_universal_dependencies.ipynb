    "## A brief introduction to Universal Dependencies as a project\n",
    "\n",
    "[Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/introduction.html), or UD for short, is a collaborative project that has two overlapping aims:\n",
    " 1. to develop a common framework for describing the grammatical structure of diverse languages (de Marneffe et al. [2021](https://doi.org/10.1162/coli_a_00402))\n",
    " 2. to create annotated corpora – or treebanks – for diverse languages that apply this framework (Nivre et al. [2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.497/))\n",
    " \n",
    "In this way, the project seeks to enable the systematic description of syntactic structures and morphological features across various languages, which naturally also enables drawing comparisons between languages. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of achieving broad applicability across diverse languages lends the project the epithet \"Universal\", whereas the term \"Dependencies\" refers to the way the framework describes syntactic structures, which will be expanded on shortly below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linguistic corpora annotated for syntactic relations are often called *treebanks*, because syntactic structures are generally represented using tree structures. In this context, then, a treebank is simply a collection of syntactic trees, which have been consistently annotated using UD or some other framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "The number of treebanks annotated using UD has grown steadily over the years (for a recent overview of 90 treebanks, see Nivre et al. [2020](https://aclanthology.org/2020.lrec-1.497/)). The design and creation of such treebanks has been documented in detail for various languages, such as Finnish (Haverinen et al. [2014](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10579-013-9244-1)), Wolof (Dione [2019](https://aclanthology.org/W19-8003/)) and Hindi/Urdu (Bhat et al. [2017](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-024-0881-2_24)).\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand the effort involved in UD as a project, one should acknowledge that developing a consistent annotation schema that can be used to describe the grammatical structure of diverse languages such as Finnish, Wolof and Hindi/Urdu is far from trivial. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additional challenges emerge from the intended use of UD treebanks: they are meant to serve both computational and linguistic research communities. As de Marneffe et al. ([2021: 302–303](https://doi.org/10.1162/coli_a_00402)) point out, the UD framework is a compromise between several competing criteria, which are provided in slightly abbreviated form below:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. UD needs to be reasonably satisfactory for linguistic analysis of individual languages\n",
    " 2. UD needs to be good for bringing out structural similarities across related languages\n",
    " 3. UD must be suitable for rapid, consistent annotation by a human annotator\n",
    " 4. UD must be easily comprehended and used by non-linguist users\n",
    " 5. UD must be suitable for computer parsing with high accuracy\n",
    " 6. UD must support well downstream natural language processing tasks\n",
    " \n",
    "The need to balance these criteria is also reflected in the design of the UD framework, which is introduced in greater detail below."

    "The Universal Dependencies framework is strongly influenced by typologically-oriented theories of grammar. These theories seek to describe and classify languages based on their structural features (for an extensive discussion of the theoretical foundations of UD, see de Marneffe et al. [2021](https://doi.org/10.1162/coli_a_00402)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic unit of analysis in UD is a word. The representation of syntactic relations, in turn, is based on **dependencies**, that is, relations that hold between words. In some aspects, however, UD diverges from traditional dependency grammars, mainly due to its need to serve the range of purposes described above (see Osborne & Gerdes [2019](https://doi.org/10.5334/gjgl.537)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The description of linguistic structures in UD is based on three types of phrasal units: **nominals**, **clauses** and **modifiers** (de Marneffe et al. [2021: 257](https://doi.org/10.1162/coli_a_00402)). These phrasal units can consist of one or more words.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this context, the notion of phrasal units refers to linguistic structures that are built around words that belong to particular word classes. Whereas nominals are used for representing things – often realised using nouns – clauses are used for representing events, which are built around verbs. Modifiers, in turn, rely on adjectives and adverbs to expand the meaning of both nominals and clauses.\n",

[2021](https://doi.org/10.1080/00437956.2021.1957545)). What these definitions have in common is that nominals are generally built around nouns.\n",

    "\n",
    "These three distinct kinds of meanings – clause as a message, clause as an exchange and clause as a representation – are encoded into every clause. As messages, clauses have a thematic structure, which allows highlighting key information. As a form of exchange, clauses allow enacting social relationships, as they are used to give and demand information or things. Finally, as a form of representation, clauses enable representing all aspects of human experience: which entities participate in what kinds of processes, and under what kinds of circumstances (Halliday and Matthiessen [2013](https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203431269): 83–85).\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand what enables clauses to perform all these functions, let's consider their *rank* among different linguistic units, as defined by Halliday and Matthiessen ([2013](https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203431269): 9–10):\n",

    "So far, we have mainly discussed the description of syntactic relations within the Universal Dependencies (UD) framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the [37 syntactic relations](https://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/) defined in UD, the framework provides [a rich schema for describing morphology](https://universaldependencies.org/u/overview/morphology.html), that is, the *form* of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "The UD schema for morphology contains three levels of representation:\n",
    " 1. A lemma, or the base form of the word\n",
    " 2. A part-of-speech tag determining the word class to which the word belongs\n",
    " 3. A set of features that define the lexical and grammatical features of the word\n",
    " \n",
    "UD defines [17 part-of-speech or word classes](https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/index.html), which can be divided into three groups:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Open class or lexical words: `ADJ ADV INTJ NOUN PROPN VERB`\n",
    " 2. Closed class or grammatical words: `ADP, AUX, CCONJ, DET, NUM, PART, PRON, SCONJ`\n",
    " 3. Other: `PUNCT, SYM, X`\n",
    " \n",
    "UD also defines a large number of [lexical and inflectional features](https://universaldependencies.org/u/feat/index.html) for describing morphological features, that is, the word forms.\n",
    "\n",
    "UD defines morphological features using two components, *names* and *values*. As we learned in [Part II](../part_ii/03_basic_nlp.ipynb), spaCy stores morphological features under the `morph` attribute of a *Token* object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define a quick example, feed it to the language model under the variable `nlp` and print out each *Token* and its morphological features.  "
