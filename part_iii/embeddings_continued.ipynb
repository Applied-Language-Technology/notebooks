    "The vector for \"a dog\" is positioned right in the middle between the vectors for \"a\" and \"dog\", because the vector for \"a dog\" is an average of the vectors for \"a\" and \"dog\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This raises the question whether averaging vectors for individual *Tokens* is suitable for representing linguistic units beyond single words, because the direction and magnitude of a vector are supposed to represent the \"meaning\" of a word in relation to those of other words in the model vocabulary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Averaging *Token* vectors for representing clauses and sentences may dilute the information encoded in the vectors. Another issue emerges from the relative weight of the averaged weights: whether the indefinite article \"a\" and the noun \"dog\" are equally important is questionable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the problem is that word embeddings are used to learn representations for a *single Token* based on their linguistic context of occurrence, but the resulting representations **do not** encode any information about the context in which the *Token* appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "Put differently, word embeddings leverage information about linguistic context during learning, but this information is not encoded into the word embeddings themselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "This limitation has been addressed in the [Transformer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformer_(machine_learning_model)), an alternative architecture for learning representations for words.\n",

    "Some models that build on this architecture include BERT (Devlin et al. [2019](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/N19-1423/)) and GPT-3 (Brown et al. [2020](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2020/hash/1457c0d6bfcb4967418bfb8ac142f64a-Abstract.html)). Both models are massive, featuring billions of parameters that encode information about words *and* the contexts in which they occur."
