    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Part II introduced basic natural language processing tasks using examples written in the English language.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a global *lingua franca*, English is a highly-resourced language in terms of natural language processing. Compared to many other languages, the amount of data – especially human-annotated data – available for English is greater and covers a wider range of domains (Del Gratta et al. [2021](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10579-020-09520-6)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the imbalance in resources and research effort has led to a situation where the advances in processing the English language are occasionally claimed to hold for natural language in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, as Bender ([2019](https://thegradient.pub/the-benderrule-on-naming-the-languages-we-study-and-why-it-matters/)) has shown, *English is not a synonym for natural language*: even if one demonstrates that computers can achieve or surpass human-level performance in some natural language processing task for the English language, this does not mean that one has solved this task or problem for *natural language as a whole*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure progress in the field of natural language processing and to ensure that as many languages as possible can benefit from advances in language technology, it is highly desirable to conduct research on processing languages used across the world. "

    "## Stanza – a Python library for processing many languages\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started with working languages other than English, we can use a library named Stanza.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Stanza](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/) is a Python library for natural language processing that provides pre-trained language models for [many languages](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/available_models.html) (Qi et al. [2020](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-demos.14/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Stanza language models are trained on corpora annotated using the [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) formalism, which means that these models can perform tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, morphological tagging and dependency parsing. \n",
    "\n",
    "These are essentially the same tasks that we explored using the spaCy natural language processing library in [Part II](../part_ii/03_basic_nlp.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start exploring Stanza by importing the library."

    "To process a given language, we must first download a Stanza language model using the `download()` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `download()` function requires a single argument, `lang`, which defines the language model to be downloaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "To download a language model for a given language, retrieve the two-letter language code (e.g. `wo`) for the language from [the list of available language models](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/available_models.html) and pass the language code as a string object to the `lang` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following code would download a model for Wolof, a language spoken in West Africa that belongs to the family of Niger-Congo languages. This model has been trained using the Wolof treebank (Dione [2019](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W19-8003/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Download Stanza language model for Wolof\n",
    "stanza.download(lang='wo')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For some languages, Stanza provides models that have been trained on different datasets. Stanza refers to models trained on different datasets as *packages*. By default, Stanza automatically downloads the package with model trained on the largest dataset available for the language in question.\n",
    "\n",
    "To select a model trained on a specific dataset, pass the name of its package as a string object to the `package` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "To exemplify, the following command would download a model for Finnish trained on the [*FinnTreeBank*](https://universaldependencies.org/treebanks/fi_ftb/index.html) (package: `ftb`) dataset instead of the default model, which is trained on the [*Turku Dependency Treebank*](https://universaldependencies.org/treebanks/fi_tdt/index.html) dataset (package: `tbt`).\n",

    "Given that Stanza currently has more pre-trained language models available than spaCy, the spacy-stanza library considerably increases the number of language models available for spaCy.\n",
