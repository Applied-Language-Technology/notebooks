    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Part II introduced basic natural language processing tasks using examples in English.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a *lingua franca*, English is a highly-resourced language in terms of natural language processing. This means that compared to other languages, English has far more resources (e.g. training and evaluation data) and models trained to perform a wider range of tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The imbalance in resources and research effort has led to a situation where the advances in processing the English language are occasionally claimed to hold for natural language in general. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, as Bender ([2019](https://thegradient.pub/the-benderrule-on-naming-the-languages-we-study-and-why-it-matters/)) has pointed out, *English is not a synonym for natural language*: even if one demonstrates that computers can achieve or surpass human-level performance in some natural language processing task for the English language, this does not mean that one has solved this task or problem for *natural language as a whole*.\n",
    "\n",
    "To measure progress in natural language processing and to ensure that as many languages as possible can benefit from advances in the field, it is highly desirable to conduct research on natural language processing for typologically different languages across the world. "

    "## Extending spaCy through Stanza\n",
    "\n",
    "[Stanza](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/) is a Python library for natural language processing that currently provides pre-trained language models for [66 languages](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/available_models.html) (Qi et al. [2020](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.acl-demos.14/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Stanza builds on the [Universal Dependencies](https://universaldependencies.org/) formalism, which means that Stanza models can perform tasks such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, morphological tagging and dependency parsing, which were introduced in [Part II](../part_ii/03_basic_nlp.ipynb) using the spaCy library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The spaCy library provides an extension named [*spacy-stanza*](https://spacy.io/universe/project/spacy-stanza) that allows using Stanza language models in spaCy, which considerably increases the number of pre-trained models available for languages other than English.\n",
    "\n",
    "To start using Stanza language models in spaCy, let's start by importing both NLP libraries and the `StanzaLanguage` class from the *spacy-stanza* library.  "
