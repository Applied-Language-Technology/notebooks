As we saw above, the vector representation for the indefinite article \"a\" remains the same regardless of the context in which this article occurs. In other words, the particular words in a model's vocabulary, such as \"a\", are always mapped to the same vector representation. The unique words in a model's vocabulary are often described as **lexical types**, whereas their instances in the data are known as **tokens**. \n",
